Library Overview
================

The IU456 library provides an easy interface to use the IMX456/IMX316 cameras.

Main features
-------------

Device discovery
****************

The library allows to:

* List available devices
* Get notifications whenever a new device is plugged in or removed

Device configuration
********************

The library allows to:

* List available modes and get some information about them such as resolution and lens intrinsics
* Select an existing mode to be used

Streaming
*********

The library allows to:

* Get the depth map and vertices
* Get the confidence


Minimum requirements
--------------------

Configuration requirements for the library are as follow:

* OS must either be Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and must be 64-bit version. 
* CPU must be 64-bit processors and must support at least `SSE4.2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>`_.
* A USB 3.0 Host controller

Configuration requirements for the viewer are as follow:

* OS must be 64-bit and either be Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.
* CPU must be 64-bit processors and must support at least `SSE4.2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>`_.
* A USB 3.0 Host controller
* OpenGL version 3.1 and later

.. note:: Support on Windows 7 depends on the USB 3.0 Host Controller manufacturer and thus is not guaranteed on this system.



Concurrent access
-----------------

The library is not meant to be used concurrently from multiple processes. This is because:

* During initialization, the EEPROM of the device must be read in order to retrieve information
  such as the device serial number and calibration data
* When an instance is in use, it is expected that no other process will interfere while
  interacting with the device (reading the EEPROM, configuring the sensor, handling the stream, ...)

.. note:: Nothing will prevent this situation to occur. In such a case the device may not work as expected.
