Building the sample
===================


Building
--------

The samples can be built using `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_.

To generate the required files for compiling the sample, the following steps are required:

* Install cmake
* Create a folder where the makefiles/solution should be generated
* Run cmake from the newly created folder with the following command:

.. code-block:: none

	cmake -DSK_PLATFORM_NAME=Windows_x64
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<install location>"
	      -G "<cmake generator>" "<path to library>\samples\c"

.. note:: The list of supported generators can be retrieved by issuing
	the following command: `cmake --help`

A typical command line on Windows could be:

.. code-block:: none

	cmake -DSK_PLATFORM_NAME=Windows_x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=".\dist" -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ".\samples\c"

Depending on the cmake generator used during the configuration:

* Open the solution in your IDE and build the INSTALL target

Running the sample
------------------

To run the sample, run the following command:

.. code-block:: none

	<install location>\bin\iu456_sample.exe
