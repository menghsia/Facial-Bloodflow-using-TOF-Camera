Known Limitations
=================

Streaming
---------

* The depth value fluctuates during the first few frames.
* In the `multi integtime` mode which is set the diference integration time for each micro frame , the integraiton time cannot be changed by set_exposure_time().

Stability
---------

* The device may not be stable and a problem may occur such as the failure to start stream. Once this happens, the device should be turned off the power and on.

* When the device is in standby mode, using the iu456_get_last_frame with an infinite timeout may return a timeout error whenever iu456_stop or iu456_set_configuration_uid is called.

* The only way to recover from an emergency shutdown of the module (for example if the laser temperature reaches the maximum tolerated value) is to restart the client application.

* In the unlikely event that the device stops sending data while in stream state, a deadlock may occur if one uses an infinite timeout in the iu456_get_last_frame function and tries to stop the streaming.

* If the emergency shutdown is called when the mode is being changed (called iu456_set_configuration_uid function) while in the stream state, the following problems may occur.
 * The iu456_set_configuration_uid function returns True even though the execution has finished in failure.
 * The camera stops the stream due to emergency shutdown and will restart after that.
 * The camera will not stop the stream even though the iu456_stop function is called. To stop the stream, call functions as following steps.
  * Call the iu456_stop.
  * Call the iu456_start.
  * Call the iu456_stop again.

API
---

The unsupported APls
********************

If the unsupported API is called , the API always returns an error.( iu456_error_generic = -1 )
The following APIs are not supported.

* `iu456_get_trigger_factor_range()`
* `iu456_get_trigger_delay_range()`
* `iu456_get_uid_for_mode()`
* `iu456_update_default_exposure_time()`
* `iu456_update_default_trigger_delay()`
* `iu456_update_default_trigger_factor()`
* `iu456_update_default_trigger_mode()`

The Windows only supported APl
********************

The following API work Windows platform. On other platform, the API always returns an error.( iu456_error_generic = -1 )

* `iu456_initialize_with_device_property()`

The API that doesn't work
*************************

The following API does not work. It returens a invalid value or nothing.

* `iu456_update_default_frame_rate()`

The return values of API
*************************

* iu456_frame_t.depth,x,y ... There is an error of up to 1.5 mm with the value of each float member.(ex: depth_float)

Feature dependence
-------------------

Auto Exposure
********************
* The overshoot/undershoot may occur.
* It is necessary for 2 frames to feedback in some modes (EE0C and 5Exx).

SW binning
********************
* iu456_get_configuration_list ... The width and height 'configuration_info_t` are incorrect for SW binning mode.
* iu456_get_current_configuration ... The width and height in `configuration_info_t` are incorrect for SW binning mode.
* sub-sampling = false : The depth/x/y values in each binning region are different due to Cartesian coordinate system conversion.

Hardware dependence
-------------------

IMX316 Sony Mini-Kit
******************************************

* There is an error of about 40 mm for the depth from the ground trues.
* The large depth deviation occurs at 1st frame [modes: FExx, EE01-06]

IMX456 Sony Mini-Kit (Laser Driver: iC-HG)
******************************************

* The depth values is not stable for about one minute due to time lag of temperature correction.
* The noise of depth is not good on modes 2004, 2005.
* The depth changes due to exposure time on all modes
* The saturation filling doesn't work on modes 100x

Mode dependence
-------------------

* The frame rate as specified does not appear in following VGA modes when the filter is enabled.
